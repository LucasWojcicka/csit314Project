# CSIT314 Project

Organising and managing events, such as conferences, corporate meetings, or social gatherings, often involves multiple moving parts, from scheduling and ticketing to attendee management and communication. Many small event organisers lack an efficient system to handle registrations, payments, and real-time updates.

This project aims to develop an Event Management System that allows organisers to create events, manage registrations, and communicate with attendees, while also enabling users to search and register for events.
